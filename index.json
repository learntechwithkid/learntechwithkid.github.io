The natural way to gain visibility is time-consuming. Therefore, users who want their tweets to get quick visibility try to\nexplore shortcuts – one such shortcut is to approach the blackmarket services, and gain retweets for their own tweets by retweeting other customers’ tweets. Thus the users intrinsically become a part of a collusive ecosystem controlled by these services. \n\nIn this paper, we propose CoReRank, an unsupervised framework to detect collusive users (who are involved in producing \nartificial retweets), and suspicious tweets (which are submitted to the blackmarket services) simultaneously. CoReRank leverages the retweeting (or quoting) patterns of users, and measures two scores – the ‘credibility’ of a user and the ‘merit’ of a tweet. We propose a set of axioms to derive the interdependency between these two scores, and update them in a recursive manner. The formulation is further extended to handle the cold start problem. CoReRank is guaranteed to converge in a finite number of iterations and has linear time complexity. We also propose a semi-supervised version of CoReRank (called CoReRank+) which leverages a partial ground-truth labeling of users and tweets. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of CoReRank compared to six baselines on a novel dataset we collected and annotated. CoReRank beats the best unsupervised baseline method by 269% (20%) (relative) average precision and 300% (22.22%) (relative) average recall in detecting collusive (genuine) users. CoReRank+ beats the best supervised baseline method by 33.18% AUC. CoReRank also detects suspicious tweets with 0.85 (0.60) average precision (recall). To our knowledge, CoReRank is the first unsupervised method to detect collusive users and suspicious tweets simultaneously with theoretical guarantees.","tags":[],"title":"CoReRank: Ranking to Detect Users Involved in Blackmarket-based Collusive Retweeting Activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hridoy Sankar Dutta","Aditya Chetan","Brihi Joshi","Tanmoy Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530383400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530383400,"objectID":"2e5f31e9dcc80ef823288acdece71fa7","permalink":"https://brihijoshi.github.io/publication/asonam-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/asonam-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Twitter has increasingly become a popular platform to share news and user opinion. A tweet is considered to be important if it receives high number of affirmative reactions from other Twitter users via Retweets. Retweet count is thus considered as a surrogate measure for positive crowd-sourced reactions - high number of retweets of a tweet not only help the tweet being broadcasted, but also aid in making its topic trending. This in turn bolsters the social reputation of the author of the tweet. Since social reputation/impact of users/t weets influences many decisions (such as promoting brands, advertisement etc.), several blackmarket syndicates have actively been engaged in producing fake retweets in a collusive manner. Users who want to boost the impact of their tweets approach the blackmarket services, and gain retweets for their own tweets by retweeting other customers' tweets. Thus they become customers of blackmarket syndicates and engage in fake activities. Interestingly, these customers are neither bots, nor even fake users - they are usually normal human beings; they express a mix of organic and inorganic retweeting activities, and there is no synchronicity across their behaviors. In this paper, we make a first attempt to investigate such blackmarket customers engaged in producing fake retweets. We collected and annotated a novel dataset comprising of customers of many blackmarket services and characterize them using a set of 64 novel features. We show how their social behavior differs from genuine users. We then use state-of-the-art supervised models to detect three types of customers (bots, promotional, normal) and genuine users. We achieve a Macro Fl-score of 0.87 with SVM, outperforming four other baselines significantly. We further design a browser extension, SCoRe which, given the link of a tweet, spots its fake retweeters in real-time. We also collected users' feedback on the performance of SCoRe and obtained 85% accuracy.","tags":["Machine Learning","Social Network Analysis","Fraud Detection"],"title":"Retweet Us, We Will Retweet You: Spotting Collusive Retweeters Involved in Blackmarket Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nishtha Madaan","Gautam Singh","Sameep Mehta","Aditya Chetan","Brihi Joshi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525113000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525113000,"objectID":"3104a01252fc312e35ef4f17ad44f817","permalink":"https://brihijoshi.github.io/publication/arxiv-ibm-2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv-ibm-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Vast availability of text data has enabled widespread training and use of AI systems that not only learn and predict attributes from the text but also generate text automatically. However, these AI models also learn gender, racial and ethnic biases present in the training data. In this paper, we present the first system that discovers the possibility that a given text portrays a gender stereotype associated with an occupation. If the possibility exists, the system offers counter-evidences of opposite gender also being associated with the same occupation in the context of user-provided geography and timespan. The system thus enables text de-biasing by assisting a human-in-the-loop. The system can not only act as a text pre-processor before training any AI model but also help human story writers write stories free of occupation-level gender bias in the geographical and temporal context of their choice.","tags":["Machine Learning","Social Network Analysis","Fraud Detection"],"title":"Generating Clues for Gender based Occupation De-biasing in Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the **Slides** button above to view the built-in slides feature.
